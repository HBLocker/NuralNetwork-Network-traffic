# Nural_Net_attackCat
Nural Network IDS, learns form dataet of network attacks. 
The aim of the project is to categorize and learn fromnetwork traffic data with machine learning. This report will cover how the data is imported and the given model used tolearn and categorize the packet capture data. This will also cover the use of scoring and analysingthe classifierperformance, this will usea mixture of accuracy data,confusion matrix data and a ROC chain.



The results gathered to show that a neural network is an efficient way in which data can be categorised but it is slow which if applied to an IDS system this could be an issue to the system as it would take time to process the data. A neural network was selected because of the method of which it processes the data and the fact optimizers can be added in which make the network accurate, the accuracy of the given network were 69% which proves that there can be room for improvement but overall it is above the 50% threshold showing it can make a good prediction from the dataset.
